# Disttracker
This is a simple tracker for
[Distrandomiser](https://github.com/TntMatthew/distrandomiser).
It provides both ability and map tracking. It's pretty simple -
you just hit the buttons, and it marks that as obtained/completed.
Web based, so it'll work on pretty much anything. Just open it
in your browser and add a window capture source in OBS.

I'm sure somebody will make a more complex tracker eventually,
possibly as a fork of this one. This is just meant to be a basic
tracker for the purpose of tracking, and I guess kind of a demo for
what a tracker could look like.
